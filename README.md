Getting started with Cura
</h3>

This is your tutorial on how to print here at the makerspace..
BE SURE TO PAY ATTENTION!

Cura is a powerful slicer we use at the makerspace, so lets get started.

For some of our printers, like the Creality Ender 3, profiles are quite simple to obtain
while for some other machines, you will have to follow a tutorial in order to be able to get printing.
